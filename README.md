# There is are Hundred of Them
This is the game that was grown up from the test work for the interview.

Simple shooter-platformer on Unity. This is about the group of thiefs that try to stol king's treasure. But they get caught.
They were sentenced to a mortal battle with a hundred monsters. Whoever survives will be pardoned.
